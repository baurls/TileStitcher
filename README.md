# TileStitcher

**A High-Resolution Map-Image-Generator**



### What ?

You define a Coordinate-Bounding box, ***TileStitcher*** **downloads** and merges the **tile-images**. This will give you a **high-resolution image** from your map-section.

It supports multiple tiling schemes - even your own tile server if desired.



### Why?

Want to print a map-segment for a giant poster? Awesome - this will meet your needs. 



### Improvements?

Bugs, ideas, improvements -let me now and we'll figure it out somehow. 



### This is great - thanks!

You're welcome :)
